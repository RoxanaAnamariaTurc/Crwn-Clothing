### Project Objectives

With this project I am looking to build a fully working e-commerce app using technologies that I have learnt in the academy as well as new technologies that I would like to get better at.

Some of the user stories for this project are below:

* As a user,
  I would like to see a home page with all the departments in the shop.
  
* As a user,
  I would like to be able to sign up, sign in and sign out from the app.

* As a user,
  I would like to use my Google account to sign in.
  
 * As a user,
   I would like to add my products to cart.
   
* As a user,
  I would like to update cart from the cart window.
