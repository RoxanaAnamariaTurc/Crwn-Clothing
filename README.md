## CRWN - Clothing


### Project Objectives

With this project I am looking to build a fully working e-commerce app using technologies that I have learnt in the academy as well as new technologies that I would like to get better at.

Some of the user stories for this project are below:

* As a user,
  I would like to see a home page with all the departments in the shop.
  
* As a user,
  I would like to be able to sign up, sign in and sign out from the app.

* As a user,
  I would like to use my Google account to sign in.
  
 * As a user,
   I would like to add my products to cart.
   
* As a user,
  I would like to update cart from the cart window.
  
* As a user,
  I would like to buy the products I like.
  

### Technologies Used

* ReactJS, 
* Javascript, 
* SCSS,
* HTML,
* Firebase platform,
* Stripe,
* Netlify

### Project Approach

* Create the folder hierarchy for the components needed
* Transform the user stories into functional components
* Set up the Firebase database and the authentication
* Set up the Netlify platform for deployment
* Web app deployed to Netlify and accessible at https://roaring-blancmange-11cd58.netlify.app/ 

### Getting Started

* Fork and clone this project on your machine and use npm i to install dependecies
* Use npm start to start the project on your local machine
* Using the Netlify platform can connect the app to the server
* Install globally netlify on your machine using the command 
` npm install netlify-cli -g `
* Once the installation is complete use `netlify` command to check that the installation is successful
* Next use the command `netlify login` to login on their platform and then use `netlify dev` to start the server, you will be redirected to localhost:8888 where the app will be fully working


### Project Review

 * This project has been really exciting and demanding while stretching my current skills and making me understand where I need to learn more
 * It was a good project to improve my knowledge and to learn a lot of new concepts and technologies

### Potential Next Steps for the Project

* As next steps I am looking to fix an error I have at the moment for the payment functionality where this is not current working as expected on the localhost:3000 ,is only available on the netlify server.

* Other than that I will be using this project to further improve the styles, adding maybe more components and increase the products on the shop section.
